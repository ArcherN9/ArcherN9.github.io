Hi! I like being anonymous, so I shan't tell my name out loud. My alias is ArcherN9 and I'm usually active on Reddit. I like talking about Linux, RaspberryPi, Azure, Open Source software and a host of other technologies. When I'm free, I'm either responding to questions on Reddit or reading a book. When I like to be left alone, one would either find me in the gym or running through a staircase. Exercising is as addictive to me as programming is.

I seldom try to come up with topics to write about; That would explain the lack of posts on this website. I'm open to interaction over email as well. Use the *email* icon on the top right corner to write to me or send me a private message on *Reddit*.
