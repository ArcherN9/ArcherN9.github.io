Hey! Thank you so much for taking the time to read through my posts and to try
to know me a little. It truly is a delight to learn that I've been able to help
someone a little in their endeavour to achieve whatever it is they set out to.

I'm an Android Architect with an immense passion for technology revolving
around Linux, Azure cloud, Mixed Reality & Android. When I'm not working, one
would ostensibly find me at the Gym, walking my dog, reading a book or spending
time with my wife & son. My alias, **ArcherN9** is a way for me to remain
anonymous and yet be recognizable on various platforms - Reddit, IRC, Random
Slack channels & more. Although I concur, I may not have done a very good job
at hiding my true identity.

I'm available for a chat on various IRC channels - #archlinux-newbie,
#archlinux-classroom, #wireguard & #xrdp on Libera.Chat, #Android on Snoonet, 
Channels - Azure, Flutter & UnixPorn on Discord servers and of course, my
[email](mailto:archern9@protonmail.com).

I'd be glad to say hi!
